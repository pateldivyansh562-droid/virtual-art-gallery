Images (<img>) with alt text and size attributes

Hyperlinks (<a>) opening in a new tab

Horizontal rules (<hr>) for section separation

Ordered lists (<ol>) for step-by-step art creation

Unordered lists (<ul>) with type and value attributes for materials used

A comparison table (<table>) with border, headers, and rows for artworks
